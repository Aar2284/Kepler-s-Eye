# Kepler-s-Eye
Kepler’s Eye is a distributed, near–real-time digital twin of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The system ingests Two-Line Element (TLE) data for 25,000+ space objects, computes their orbital trajectories using distributed processing (Apache Spark), identifies potential collision risks, and visualizes results on an interactive 3D globe.
